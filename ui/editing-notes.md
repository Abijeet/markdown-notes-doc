## Notes from the image

The numbers in the prefix of the headings below represent the numbers in the image.

### 1. Icons in the textbox

A normal editor will display two icons - **Delete** and **Edit**. If a editor is inside a **Task** based list, it will also contain a **Checkbox** that denotes the state of the task. When a user checks a checkbox, it tells the system that the user has finished that task.

These icons will be only visible when the editor has focus.

### 2. a. Add new note

Clicking on this button will add an editor at the bottom of all existing editor and will put the focus in the editor, so the user can begin typing immediately.

### 2. b. Settings 

This will popup out the dialog described here. 

### 3. Note date

On an active notebook this shows the date from the current, clicking on it will open the calendar. The description for this screen can be found here.

### 4. The status bar

This status bar contains application related messages. If a user carried out an action such as - Marking a note as completed, this would contain a status message that shows whether that action was executed successfully by the system.

If there is an error though, the system will inform that to the user via a dialog box, and will try to offer them a resolution. So the status bar will generally only contain messages when actions have been completed successfully.

### 5. List of notebooks

### 6. Tabbed interface

### 7. a. My Profile

### 7. b. Logout

### 8. Date on in progress tasks
